# TYPEFLOOD RACER

Challenge your friends to a game of typing showdown and stress test Neon Dev testnet (you can also configure it to test other networks too) by spamming it with tons of transactions! Since when do you get paid to SPAM!?

## Overview

Typeflood Racer is a thrilling "type to earn" game that rewards players for their typing speed and accuracy, while uniquely incorporating a crowdsourcing and gamified solution to stress and load test blockchain test networks. The concept is straightforward: the faster and more accurately you type, the more transactions (txns) you generate, leading to the minting of tokens as rewards.

This browser extension can be installed and utilized on any typing game website, offering players the flexibility to race while engaging in various productive tasks, such as answering emails. However, unlike traditional concerns about spamming, Typeflood Racer encourages users to generate a substantial volume of transactions intentionally. This feature serves a specific goal: to contribute to the stress and load testing of blockchain test networks.

By incentivizing users to participate actively and produce a higher number of transactions, Typeflood Racer assists in simulating real-world network scenarios, helping developers identify potential vulnerabilities and enhance the overall resilience and efficiency of blockchain systems. Players can enjoy the game's rewards and simultaneously contribute to the improvement of blockchain technologies.

It is essential to approach Typeflood Racer responsibly and ensure that users are aware of its unique purpose in contributing to blockchain test networks. With proper understanding and responsible engagement, this gamified approach provides an exciting opportunity for users to enhance their typing skills while making a valuable impact on the development and stability of blockchain technology.
